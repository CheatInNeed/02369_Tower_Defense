Summary of meeting 30/10

User Stories <br>

We went through the feedback we received from the last assignment. A large part of the feedback was that our user stories were too broad. We revisited them and discussed how we could make them more precise.

LibGDX <br>
We briefly discussed the LibGDX library. Three of us had the assignment to get hands-on experience with it. We agreed that everyone should continue working with it and developing their skills.

Sprint 0 <br>
We talked about Sprint 0 and were all satisfied with our progress.

Sprint 1 <br>
We started planning Sprint 1. We want to do pair programming, working in pairs to implement simple user stories. We agreed to meet on Tuesday, 06/11, for a stand-up where we will discuss what went well and what could be improved. We will also set aside time to help each other if we encounter any difficulties.
